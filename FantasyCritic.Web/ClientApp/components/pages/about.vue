      <p>
        Fantasy Critic was created by me, Steve Fallon. The visual design for the site was created by Dale Mahabir.
        As of now, this site is brand new and there are bound to be bugs, oversights, and design issues. However, I am committed to improving the site for the foreseeable future.
        I created this site because I wanted to merge my love of video games with my love of fantasy football. I think anyone that likes both of those things will have a great time playing Fantasy Critic.
