            <a href="https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=908453581110280232&scope=bot&permissions=2147502080" target="_blank">

          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            The official Fantasy Critic bot was co-developed by
            <a href="https://github.com/rarDevelopment" target="_blank">Robert (rardk64)</a>
            and myself (Steve Fallon), and is integrated into the site itself.
          </p>

          <h4>Setup Instructions</h4>
          <p>To set up the bot, do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, we
              <em>highly</em>
              recommend
              <router-link :to="{ hash: '#link-discord-account' }">linking your Discord account</router-link>
              to this site if you haven't already. This is safe and will make for easier use of the bot.
            </li>
            <li>Click the link above to invite the bot to your Discord server. It requires all permissions that it requests.</li>
            <li>
              Set up the bot in your Discord server's preferred channel(s). You can do this in any of the following ways (see
              <router-link :to="{ hash: '#how-to-use' }" @click.native="showCollapse('how-to-use')">How To Use The Bot</router-link>
              below for more info):
              <ul>
                <li>
                  For
                  <router-link :to="{ hash: '#set-league' }" @click.native="showCollapse('set-league')">League Updates</router-link>
                  use the
                  <code>/set-league</code>
                  command in the appropriate channel(s).
                </li>
                <li>
                  For
                  <router-link :to="{ hash: '#game-news-settings' }" @click.native="showCollapse('game-news-settings')">Game News</router-link>
                  use the
                  <code>/game-news-settings</code>
                  command in the appropriate channel(s).
                </li>
                <li>You can also use both commands in the same channel to configure your channel to receive both types of updates!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h4 id="link-discord-account">Linking Your Discord Account to Fantasy Critic</h4>
          <p>
            <strong>How?</strong>
            To link your Discord account,
            <a href="/Account/Manage/ExternalLogins">click here</a>
            , click Link Discord Account, and click Authorize.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why?</strong>
            Linking your Discord account to Fantasy Critic allows the bot to know your Fantasy Critic account when using the bot from your Discord channel. Doing this allows easier use of commands,
            and will allow us to give you more information directly in Discord in certain functions.

            <li>Game score changes</li>

            This was also the first Fantasy Critic bot to use Discord's slash commands feature, and working on this together is what led us to decide to take on the task of making the official bot.
