              The difference between a "Custom Rules League" and a "Test League" is that a "Custom Rules League" will still be listed alongside your normal leagues and you will see upcoming games for
              that league on your home page. There is a dedicated home page tab for test leagues, and the games are not listed in your upcoming games on the home page. The "Custom Rules League" option
              is new as of 2023, and you
              <em>are</em>
              allowed to change your "Test League" into a "Custom Rules League", since neither affect the site's stats.
