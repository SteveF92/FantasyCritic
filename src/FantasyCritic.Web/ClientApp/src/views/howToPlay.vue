              <li>Have them create an account and then create a league. Here, they’ll be able to decide:</li>

          <h2>Plan your draft</h2>
          <div class="text-well">
            <p>
              The earlier in the year you can do your draft, the better, as there are more games still to be released. The site doesn't schedule your draft for you, start it automatically, or enforce
              any time limits, but we encourage you to communicate with your league about when you want to hold the draft, and set aside some time to complete your draft in one session.
            </p>
            <div>
              You can run your draft with:
              <ul>
                <li>Each player logged into the site on their own devices</li>
                <li>The league manager handling all assignments</li>
              </ul>
              Either will work fine, or you can have a mix. For example, if you have a six person league, with five of them together in person and one more absent, the league manager can handle
              drafting for the five while the other player handles their games. It makes no difference.
            </div>
            <p>
              However many people you have, we
              <em>strongly</em>
              reccommend setting aside at least an hour to dedicate to your draft. While being together in person is not required, we do think that is the most fun way to do it. Unless there's a
              pandemic. Then take appropriate precautions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, make sure to set your draft order. Different groups may like to decide this in different ways. There is no obvious best position in the draft, so different players may prefer to
              be first, last, or somewhere in the middle. If you don't change anything, the system will default to the order in which people joined the league. You can choose to set a custom order, or
              you can tell the site to randomize the order.

              Okay, so it's draft time! The league manager starts the draft, and the first player up will choose their first game. After that, each player will follow suit. After every player has a
              game, the player that choose last in the first round will choose first in the second round. This is called a "snake draft".
            </p>
            <p>
              Once every player has drafted all of their games, each player will choose their counter picks. For more info,
