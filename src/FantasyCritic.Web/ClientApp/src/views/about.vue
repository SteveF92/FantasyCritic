          Fantasy Critic was created by me, Steve Fallon. The visual design for the site was created by

          . I work on the site solely in my spare time, and there are bound to be bugs, oversights, and design issues. However, I am committed to improving the site for the foreseeable future. I
          created this site because I wanted to merge my love of video games with my love of fantasy football. I think anyone that likes both of those things will have a great time playing Fantasy
          Critic.

      <h2>A little history</h2>
      <div class="text-well">
        <h4>The beginnings</h4>
        <p>
          I had the idea for Fantasy Critic in late 2017. I was already a big fantasy football fan, and I had a group of friends that I wanted to form a league with. Problem: most of them don't really
          like football. So I got to thinking about how to apply the idea of fantasy football to something we do all like. I'm not totally sure when the moment was, but that's about when I had the
          idea for Fantasy Critic. Before it was ever a website, it was a 3 page document outlining the basic rules. Some of the details have changed, but the core idea of the game hasn't changed
          since then. My friends and I played through all of 2018 using a Google Sheet as our record keeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote the first bits of code that would become this site in January 2018, but I didn't really begin in earnest until June. For most of the second half of 2018, I worked on Fantasy Critic
          nearly every day. I hired a friend of mine, Dale Mahabir, to help with the visual design of the site in late September. Things started taking shape quickly in the last few months of the
          year. I "soft" launched the site in December 2018, by posting on a few programming subreddits.
        </p>

        <p>
          At the time I'm writing this section (early January 2019), the site is "officially" launched, but we're just getting started. The site's first major advertisement - on the
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZrxXp1reP8E353rZsB3jaA" target="_blank">
            Easy Allies
            <font-awesome-icon icon="external-link-alt" size="sm" />
          </a>
          Podcast - airs in about a week. I couldn't be more excited for people to start playing. I hope you find it as entertaining as my friends and I already have.
        </p>

        <h4>2021 Update</h4>
        <p>
          Fantasy Critic has now been live for 2 full years. The site has grown from just my closest friends to nearly ten thousand users. There are now a handful of extremely engaged users that
          frequently assist with answering user questions, fixing errors with the games list, and even contributing code. It's so incredible to me to see this community spring up around this thing I
          created. If you've been a user for a while, or you're just starting now, please know that I'm super happy to have you here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site continues to grow in features as well. In late 2019 I added "Critic's Royale", with the goal of making the site easier to jump into. 2020 saw the addition of "game dropping", which
          was intended to keep people engaged throughout the year, even if some of their games get delayed. For 2021, the big new feature so far is a streamlining of the "eligibility" system, which
          let's you choose what games you can select in your leagues. I have more planned for later in the year as well, including a way to handle "shadow drops".
        </p>

        <h4>2024 Update</h4>
        <p>
          At the time I'm writing this, Fantasy Critic has now been live for 5 years. The site is close to thirty thousand users and is great shape overall. A few years ago I had the opportunity to
          spend a few months working on the site full time, which was a great experience. Many new features were added during that time, and I started a Patreon which really helps to cover the server
          costs to run the site. While the pace of updates has slowed since then, Fantasy Critic is still a very important project to me and I will continue to manage and update it for years to come.
        </p>

        <p>
          2024 brings a few new features, most notably Conferences, which are intended to be used for groups that are too big to fit in one league. Another feature that deserves special mention is the
          official Discord bot, which actually debuted late in the 2022 season but has now become an essential part of the site. For that, I need to give big thanks to
          <a href="https://rardk.com" target="_blank">rardk64</a>
          , who has been a great partner in development these past few years.
