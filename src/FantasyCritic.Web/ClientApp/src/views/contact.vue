            The subreddit admittedly doesn't see as much traffic as it used to, as it's been largely supplanted by our Discord. However, it may still be where you want to go if you want to post
            something very detailed like a feature proposal. I do still check it, but you'll get a faster response from both myself and the community on our Discord.

        <h3>Account issues</h3>
        <p>
          If you have an issue with your account(can't login, can't verify email, etc), please reach out to me directly via DM on Discord or Twitter. Additionally, if one of your league members is
          having issues with their account, you should have them reach out to me directly, rather than contacting me on their behalf.
        </p>
        <h3>Other Issues</h3>
        <p>
          I'm always happy to respond to a DM, but if your issue is not an account issue, you can also post in our #tech-support channel in our Discord. In particular, if you have an issue with the
          <router-link :to="{ name: 'discordBot' }">Discord Bot</router-link>
          , you should definitely post that in the channel as opposed to a DM.
