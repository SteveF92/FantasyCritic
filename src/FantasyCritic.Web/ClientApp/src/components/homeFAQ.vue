      <template #header>How many players can be in a league?</template>
      <template #body>Anywhere from 2 to 20. Somewhere between 4 and 10 is probably optimal, and I'd be apprehensive about going over 14, but you can do it.</template>

      <template #header>How long does a league last?</template>
      <template #body>
        Each calendar year is one “game” of Fantasy Critic. Everyone starts fresh with a new roster at the start of each new year, but you are free to keep playing in the same league with the same
        people year after year.
